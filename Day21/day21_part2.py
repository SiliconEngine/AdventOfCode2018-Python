"""Advent of Code 2018, Day 21, Part 2

Given a program that runs on the CPU from day 16, figure out what number
will cause the program to execute "the most number of instructions". The
algorithm produces a repeating stream of numbers, so it has to figure out
what the last number it produces before it repeats.

The algorithm itself is very slow to execute on the pseudo-CPU, so it required
analyzing the algorithm. The semi-optimized version that still does things
more-or-less the same way takes 55 seconds. I also boiled down the algorithm
into optimized Python that does it in 4ms.

The algorithm itself is a hashing function that feeds the same number in over
and over, which eventually causes a repeating cycle.

I would imagine the puzzle varies the two constants, which are read from the
program data for these optimized versions.

See test.dat for sample data and program.dat for full data.
